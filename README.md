Setting Windows 10 Wallpaper time-based

## Getting started
1. Backgroundr expects 1.jpg (Night), 2.jpg (Morning), 3 (Day). jpg, 4.jpg (Evening) in the working directory. 
2. dotnet restore
3. dotnet run

## Notes
- I used the awesome wallpaper class provided by Neil N https://stackoverflow.com/users/55164/neil-n shared here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1061678/change-desktop-wallpaper-using-code-in-net#comment12939266_1061682
- There is no ui after running
- Add to autostart for continuous use
